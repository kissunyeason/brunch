<!-- Installation Guides -->
# Introduction
Linuxloops is a general purpose linux distro installer that also supports brunch and is available at: [https://github.com/sebanc/linuxloops][linuxloops]  
Linuxloops will perform automatically most of the brunch install steps (notably downloading brunch, downloading the ChromeOS recovery image, installing build dependencies and running the install script).  
  
# Install from Linux
  
<details>
  <summary>Install Brunch to a USB drive</summary>
  
### Requirements
- x86_64 based computer with UEFI boot support  
- Root access.  
- 8 GB available in your home directory.  
- Target USB must be 16 GB minimum.  
  
### Install process
1. Identify the recovery suitable for your CPU:  
  
#### Intel
* 8th gen & 9th gen: "[shyvana][recovery-shyvana]" for Intel / "[bobba][recovery-bobba]" for Celeron.  
* 10th gen: "[jinlon][recovery-jinlon]".  
* 11th gen & above: "[voxel][recovery-voxel]".  
#### AMD
* Ryzen: "[gumboz][recovery-gumboz]".  
  
2. Install the zenity package for your distro:
  
Debian-based distro: `sudo apt install zenity`  
Arch-based distro: `sudo pacman -S zenity`  
Fedora-based distro: `sudo dnf install zenity`  
  
3. Download the linuxloops script.  
  
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebanc/linuxloops/main/linuxloops -o ~/linuxloops`  
  
4. Launch the linuxloops script and follow the GUI installer selecting "Brunch" as the distro and the recovery compatible with your CPU as the environment.  
  
`sudo bash ~/linuxloops`  
 
 If there is an error in the download process (especially in some areas where VPN is required, such as China), you can check the download address displayed in the window, use a third-party download tool to download "archlinux-rootfs.tar.xz", and copy it to ~ /.linuxloops directory, run sudo bash ~/linuxloops again
  
Choose "disk" at the install type prompt and select your USB flashdrive as destination.  
  
5. Once the install process is finished, reboot your computer and select your USB drive as boot device.  
  
6. (secure boot enabled) A blue screen saying `Verification failed: (15) Access Denied` may appear upon boot.  
  * To enroll the key directly from a USB, select OK -> Enroll key from disk -> EFI-SYSTEM -> brunch.der -> Continue and reboot.  
  
### Next Steps
It is normal for the first boot to take a very long time, please be patient.  
  
* The first boot is the best time to setup anything important such as [changing kernels][changing-kernels] or [framework options][framework-options] by selecting the "ChromeOS (Settings)" boot option.  
* If you have any issues, it is strongly advised to check out the [Brunch Configuration Menu][edit-brunch-config] for possible patches or solutions.

  <summary>Install Brunch to a HDD/SSD</summary>
  
### Requirements
- x86_64 based computer with UEFI boot support  
- Root access.  
- 8 GB available in your home directory.  
- A USB drive that must be 16 GB minimum.  
- A HDD/SSD drive that must also be 16 GB minimum.  
  
### Install process
1. Make a Brunch USB flashdrive using the above "Install Brunch to a USB drive" guide.  
  
2. Boot the ChromeOS USB drive, and switch to the TTY2 terminal with **Ctrl + Alt + F2**, then login as `chronos`.  
  
3. Before continuing, you will need to know what disk you want to install to. Be absolutely sure **before** you continue, this installation will erase **everything** on that disk, including other partitions. The disk must be at least 16 GB, or the installation will fail. There are several ways to determine which disk is your target, in this example we will use `lsblk`.  
  
`lsblk -e7`  
  
4. Once you've determined your target disk, you're ready to install Brunch.  
  * Replace `disk` in the below command with your target disk. (Such as `sdb`, `mmcblk0` or `nvme0n1` for example)  
  
`sudo chromeos-install -dst /dev/disk`  
  
The script will ask for confirmation. If you're ready to install, type `yes` into the prompt.  
  
5. Reboot your computer and select your HDD/SDD in the boot menu.  
  
### Next Steps
It is normal for the first boot to take a very long time, please be patient.  
  
* The first boot is the best time to setup anything important such as [changing kernels][changing-kernels] or [framework options][framework-options] by selecting the "ChromeOS (Settings)" boot option.  
* If you have any issues, it is strongly advised to check out the [Brunch Configuration Menu][edit-brunch-config] for possible patches or solutions.

- 8 GB available in your home directory.  
- An unencrypted partition with 14 GB available (in ext4, btrfs, ntfs or exfat format).  
- GRUB as bootloader.  
  
### Install process
1. Identify the recovery suitable for your CPU:  
  
#### Intel
* 8th gen & 9th gen: "[shyvana][recovery-shyvana]" for Intel / "[bobba][recovery-bobba]" for Celeron.  
* 10th gen: "[jinlon][recovery-jinlon]".  
* 11th gen & above: "[voxel][recovery-voxel]".  
#### AMD
* Ryzen: "[gumboz][recovery-gumboz]".  
  
2. Install the zenity package for your distro:  
  
Debian-based distro: `sudo apt install zenity`  
Arch-based distro: `sudo pacman -S zenity`  
Fedora-based distro: `sudo dnf install zenity`  
  
3. Download the linuxloops script.  
  
`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebanc/linuxloops/main/linuxloops -o ~/linuxloops`  
  
4. Launch the linuxloops script and follow the GUI installer selecting "Brunch" as the distro and the recovery compatible with your CPU as the environment.  
  
`sudo bash ~/linuxloops`  
  
Choose "image" at the install type prompt, place the image on an unencrypted parition and define the disk image size.  
  
5. At the end of the install process, the GUI installer will provide you with a command that will generate the needed GRUB configuration. Run it in a terminal.  
  
6. (secure boot enabled) Once install is finished, run:  
  
`sudo mokutil --import <image_path>/<image_name>.img.der`  

7. Reboot your computer and launch Brunch from GRUB.  
  
### Next Steps
It is normal for the first boot to take a very long time, please be patient.  
  
* The first boot is the best time to setup anything important such as [changing kernels][changing-kernels] or [framework options][framework-options] by selecting the "ChromeOS (Settings)" boot option.

# [Troubleshooting and Support][troubleshooting-and-faqs]
  
See the full [Troubleshooting and Support][troubleshooting-and-faqs] page if you're having issues.  
  
### Additional Tips
* If you're having trouble booting a Brunch USB, make sure that UEFI is enabled in the BIOS.  
* Some PCs require a key to be held when booting to boot from USB or that USB booting is enabled in the BIOS.  
* The first boot can take up to an hour on some hardware. Brunch does not typically freeze on the Brunch logo. If you are seeing the Brunch logo, the system is _probably_ still booting.  
* If your PC is stuck on the ChromeOS logo (White background), it is likely that you've got an incompatible dedicated GPU.  
* If you get a blue screen saying "Verification failed" you can either disable secure boot in your bios settings, or [enroll the secure boot key][secure-boot].  
  * To enroll the key directly from a USB, select OK -> Enroll key from disk -> EFI-SYSTEM -> brunch.der -> Continue and reboot.  
* If the system reboots _itself_ when booting normally, then Brunch has run into an error and you may need to do some advanced troubleshooting.
